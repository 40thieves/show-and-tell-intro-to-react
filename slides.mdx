# Intro to React
### Show & Tell - February 2019

## Code Your Future class

This is heavily based on the React class I taught a couple of times

If you want to read the longer version - including exercises - you can read it
[here](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/react/week-19/lesson.html)

---

## What's the problem?

Updating the DOM manually is verbose, potentially buggy and slow.

```js
var divNode = document.createElement('div')
var textNode = document.createTextNode('Hello World')
divNode.appendChild(textNode)

var rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
rootElement.appendChild(divNode)
```

---

### Let's try some React

```js
const element = React.createElement('div', {
  children: 'Hello World'
})

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
```

---

## Now with JSX

```js
import React from 'react'

const element = <div>Hello World</div>

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
```

## Interpolation

```js
<span>{1 + 2 + 3}</span>
```

```js
const weather = {
  temperature: 5,
  location: 'London'
}
<p>The temperature in {weather.location} is {weather.temperature}</p>
```

```js
const people = ['Ali', 'John', 'Chrystal', 'Doug', 'Christopher']
return (
  <span>{people.join(', ')}</span>
)
```

```notes
Everything inside the curly braces is "Just JavaScript". That means we can use
"Just JavaScript" to manipulate our data. We don't have to learn a proxy via a
templating language like Pug.
```

---

## React Components

```js
import React from 'react'

function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>Hello World</div>
  )
}
```

We'd use that component like this:

```js
<HelloWorld />
```

---

export default Split

<div>
Our component:

```js
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div className="hello">
      <b>Hello World</b>
    </div>
  )
}
```
</div>

<div>
Becomes:

```js
{
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    className: 'hello',
    children: {
      type: 'b',
      children: 'Hello World'
    }
  }
}
```
</div>

```notes
React components return React "elements" which are Plain-Old JavaScript Objects
which are lightweight "descriptions" of what we want the DOM to look like.

They are much cheaper to create and update than "real" DOM elements. This is
really important later when we look at how React updates the DOM.
```

---

## Props

```js
<Greeting greeting="Hi" />
```

```js
const Greeting = (props) => (
  <span>{props.greeting}</span>
)
```

```notes
Props are like "arguments" to components. It's how we pass data down the
component tree
```

---

## Class Components

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello {this.props.greeting}</div>
    )
  }
}
```

```notes
So far we've looked at the simplest type of components, not much more useful
than a templating language. However React has special Super Powers™️ that are
enabled through the Component class.

To convert a functional component (what we have seen so far) into a class
component, it's mostly just copy/pasting the function into the `render` method
of the class. Props are accessed via this.props
```

---

## Accessing the Super Powers™️

<div style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>

```js
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }
  increment = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => {
      return { count: prevState.count + 1 }
    })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Count: {this.state.count}
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Click me!</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</div>

[Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/mqp753xr19)

```notes
Ok, so there's a lot going on here.

Firstly, we've added some "state". This is one of the class component Super
Powers™️. We initialise that state in the class `constructor` to set the `count`
to zero.

Inside our `render` method, we display the current count with
`this.state.count`. We also have a button that has a special `onClick` prop that
is passed a reference to the `increment` method. Note the difference between
Angular and React: in Angular you give call the function in an `ng-click`. In
React, you pass the function reference for React to call for you.

The `increment` method calls a "magic" `this.setState` method (that is provided
by the React component). This does 2 things: It updates the state so that our
count is increment. But now our UI is out of date! It's still showing the
previous count.

This is the second function of `this.setState`: it tells React that our UI is
dirty and needs to be updated. This is where the process of "reconciliation"
comes in.
```

## Reconciliation

```notes
The simplest thing it could do is to throw away the entire DOM and rebuild it
from scratch. This is in fact exactly what the first (internal) version of React
did!

This has obvious performance problems. Instead React follows a tree diff
algorithm between the "real" DOM and our "description" of the DOM, via React
elements. Once it knows what is different it efficiently updates only the nodes
which need changing.
```

---

## UI becomes a function of a component and data

<div style={{ fontSize: 80, marginTop: '5%' }}>
(component, data) => UI
</div>

```notes
You have to squint a little to be able to see this, but what I mean is that
given a component and data, it is guaranteed to always render the same UI every
time.

This - to me - is the core useful thing about React. It frees us from having to
manage the DOM as it changes over time. If we update the data, the React will
change the UI to match.
```
